A sand table is a kinetic sculpture that uses a metal ball to silently create and/or erase beautiful patterns in sand. A single steel ball is controlled by hidden magnets underneath, which push and roll the ball over a bed of fine white sand. Precisely controlled motors create exquisite complex details by shifting the ball in small steps. The basic mechanism is simple enough. The table uses a Cartesian motion platform to move a magnet underneath a table. On top of the table, a metal sphere attached to the magnet moves through craft sand to draw attractive patterns. A PLC or SBC works to command the stepper motors to create various patterns in the sand.
